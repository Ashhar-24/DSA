This repository contains my personal solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems from platforms like **GeeksforGeeks**, **LeetCode**, **CodeForces**, and **CodeChef**. Most problems also include attached notes or explanations linked with the code.

All solutions are pushed automatically using a custom browser extension I built, which works on both Chromium browsers (like Chrome and Brave) and Firefox.
